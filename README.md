# stock-reccomender
A web application built using reactjs and nodejs which allows a user to input 5 different stocks they are interested in. The backend with make api calls to marketstack.com to obtain the closing stock price for the past 200 days. Then the program computes the 50 and 200 day moving averages for each stock based off of this data. If the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day average, this is a positive indicator and the stock will be recommended, otherwise it will not be recommended. On the extremely rare chance that the 50 and 200 day moving averages are exactly the same, the program will tell the user that it is neutral towards the stock.
